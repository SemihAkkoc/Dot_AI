# Dot_AI

In this programme I learned about how to implement natural selection and mutations into code. I have created a little game that our goal is to get our dot into the blue dot. Then I created 1000 dots and released them into wilderness and magic happened with natural selection :D There is a gif about how it looks (I couldn't oriantated the windows so gif does not look great :( )
